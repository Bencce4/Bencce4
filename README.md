## About

Alongside my studies, I build applied software and AI-driven automation systems.

I’m open to developing any kind of project — whether that’s data pipelines, messaging bots, ML experiments, or custom automation tools for clients.

## Flagship Projects

### Rotation-Equivariant ALIKED Feature Matching (Internship)
PyTorch, LightGlue, ALIKED, OpenCV

Developed a hybrid rotation-equivariant descriptor steering system to achieve keypoint matching under large rotations.

- Custom SO(2)-based descriptor steerer
- Patch-based orientation predictor (sin/cos regression)
- Multi-phase training pipeline
- LightGlue-guided match supervision
- Descriptor equivariance + composition losses

### SMS Recruitment Assistant (Private)
FastAPI, Docker, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API, Twilio/Infobip

Production prototype that automates first-round recruitment screening over SMS.

- Stateful candidate conversations
- Prompt-engineered qualification flows
- Hetzner VM deployment
- Webhook ingestion & retry logic

---

### Reinforcement Learning Systems
Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-learning, SARSA, Dyna-Q

Implementations of model-free and model-based RL algorithms with convergence analysis and experiment design.

---

### CNN Food Image Classifier
PyTorch

Custom CNN for multi-class food classification with augmentation and evaluation tooling.
